- Differentiate between machine learning and traditional statistical methods.
- Recognize the trade-offs involved in modeling decisions.
- Learn best practices for data splitting and allocation in the modeling process.
- Discover the purpose and structure of tidymodels.
- Apply tidymodels through practical examples.
- Understand the foundational components of tidymodels.
- A solid understanding of L1 and L2 penalties.  


## Types of Models
::: panel-tabset

### Descriptive

- Describe or illustrate characteristics of some data. 
- No other purpose than to visually emphasize some trend or artifact in the data.

:::
### Inferential

- Explore a specific hypothesis: statistical tests are used. 
An inferential model starts with a predefined conjecture or idea about a population and produces a statistical conclusion such as an interval estimate or the rejection of a hypothesis.

- For example, the goal of a clinical trial might be to provide confirmation that a new therapy does a better job in prolonging life

### Predictive

- Produce the most accurate prediction possible
Predicted values have the highest possible fidelity to the true value of the new data.

## Machine Learning vs. "Traditional Statistics"?

::: panel-tabset

### Statisticians 
- Care about variability.
- Care about defining the range of normal values across samples (the standard error).  
- Focus on estimating betas

$${y} = \alpha + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \dots + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon$$

### Machine Learning -People-

- Care about prediction.   

- Focus on estimating y-hat.
  
  $$\hat{y} = \hat{f}(x_1)$$
- $\hat{y}$ Represents the resulting prediction for $Y$.
- $\hat{f}$ Represents the estimate for $f$, which is often treated as a blackbox (No one is concerned with the exact form of $\hat{f}$, provided that it yields accurate predictions for $Y$)

## Tradeoff Bias/Variance

- "When we discuss prediction models, prediction errors can be decomposed into two main subcomponents we care about: **error due to "bias"** and **error due to "variance"**." ([Fortman-Roe, 2012](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html)) 

- "There is a tradeoff between a model's ability to minimize bias and variance." ([Fortman-Roe, 2012](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html))

### Bias
The error due to bias is taken as the **difference** between the **expected** (or average) prediction of our model and the **correct** value which we are trying to predict.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
### Variance
The error due to variance is taken as the variability of a model prediction for a given data point.   
- The variance is how much the predictions for a given point vary between different realizations of the model.

## How do we Spend our Data?

## How do we Spend our Data?

For machine learning, we split data into training and test sets:

1. The **training** set is used to estimate model parameters.

2. The **testing** set is used to find an independent assessment of model performance.

ðŸš« CAUTION:
Do not use the test set during training.

## Resampling Methods 

They are a tool consisting in repeatedly drawing samples from a dataset and calculating statistics and metrics on each of those samples.

## Crossvalidation 
This approach involves randomly dividing the set of observations into k folds of nearly equal size. The first fold is treated as a validation set and the model is fit on the remaining folds.

## Leave one out 
Only one observation is used for validation and the rest is used to fit the model.

## The Actual Process: {.smaller}

1. Collect Data
2. Data exploration and preparation. 
3. Model training 
4. Model evaluation *(Don't PANIC will cover this next session)*.  
  + Look at RMSE or contingency table statistics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, etc)
5. Model improvement
  + Tweak preparation, reparametrize a method or use a different method
6. Use the test data to evaluate the final model.
7. Share/Publish results
