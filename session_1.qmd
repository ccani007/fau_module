## Defining Data Science 

Data Science allows you to transform raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge [@wickham2023r]

The Data Science Association: 

Data Science: "The scientific study of the creation, validation and transformation of data to create meaning"

Statistics: "The practice or science of collecting and analysing numerical data in large quantities"

- There is a disagreement between academics over the terminology, value and contribution of both disciplines [@hassani2021]
